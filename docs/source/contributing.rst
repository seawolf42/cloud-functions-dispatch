Pull requests are welcome, espeically if they address issues filed against the project.

Before starting local development, you will need a python environent (using whatever virtual environent tooling you prefer) installed in or symlinked from ``./env``. Then type ``make reqs.clean reqs`` to install all dependencies.

Local tests are run by typing ``make test`` in the project folder.
